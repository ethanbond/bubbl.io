==What is bubbl.io?
Bubbl.io is a file-collaboration service that has no registration mechanism. Think of it as a disposable DropBox. It's fast, private, easy to share, and simple.

==How do I use this...?
Dragging and dropping a file at the homepage will automatically create a new bubbl for you. From there, you can generate links to give to your collaborators. After 7 days of a link not being used, it disappears. If there are no links associated with a bubbl, the bubbl will pop and disappear as well.

==So what's a bubbl?
A bubbl is a container for your files. Anyone who sees it can edit anything inside of it, so only give links to those who you trust. Bubbls can be of unlimited size, but each file inside of one can only be 20mb or less. It stores any type of file, but some types you'll have to download to edit.
